Just a project sample to get familiar with python projetct structure  


# The mental model
# When working with multiple files, always think about two things:
# Where am I? - What folder is my Python script in?
# Where do I want to go? - What file or module do I need?
# Then navigate:
# Going down into subfolders: Use / for files, . for imports
# Going up to parent folders: Use ../ for files, add to sys.path for imports
# Same folder: Just use the filename
